This is the second biweekly update of the IOG GHC DevX team.

## JS backend

### Discussion about JS backend maturity

TODO: lower expectations about the JS/Wasm backends


### JS backend in the browser tutorial

Josh updated the draft of our upcoming JS backend tutorial after reviews:
https://github.com/input-output-hk/engineering/pull/24

### Cabal support for js-sources

Sylvain added tests to his patch adding cabal support for the `js-sources`
stanza when GHC is used as a compiler (and not only when GHCJS is used as a
compiler), allowing the patch to be merged:
https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/8636

https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/8639 is still open though so be careful
if you try to use `js-sources`, they still don't work in some cases.


### JS backend CI

TODO: Jeff, CI MRs status

### JS backend: Template Haskell

Sylvain continued his work on the implementation of Template Haskell for the JS
backend.
He factorized the code from `iserv` and `libiserv` into the `ghci` library,
making GHC able to easily load and run the external interpreter server (`iserv`)
compiled into JavaScript in a NodeJS instance.
He modified GHC to avoid creating ByteCode objects (which are unsupported by the
JS backend) and to instead compile and link JavaScript codes.

It works well so Template Haskell basically works with the JS backend now,
except for a few corner cases (e.g. one-shot mode) that should be fixed in the
coming days/weeks.

Luite modified Sylvain's JS code to fix support for Darwin and Windows. If you
want to test it, a draft merge request has been opened:
https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/9779

### JS EDSL

TODO: Jeff


### FileStat

TODO: Josh (MR opened, waiting for CI)


### Blog posts

TODO: Luite (new blog posts about GHCJS)


### Docker image

Sylvain debugged a configuration issue of GHC with the JS backend (see #22814).
The recommended way is to use the following command line:

```
emconfigure ./configure --target=js-unknown-ghcjs
```

where `emconfigure` is provided by the Emscripten project and sets appropriate
environment variables (CC, LD, AR...).

However in some cases it seems like these variables are set as follows:

```
CC=emcc
LD=emcc
...
```

in which case GHC's `configure` script will silently ignores them... and uses the
C compiler for the host platform instead (x86-64, aarch64...). As the C compiler
is only used for the CPP pass, it results in some inscrutable errors. In #22814
the error is due to `CSize` being inferred as a 64-bit type while it should be
32-bit for the JavaScript platform, leading to CSize values being passed as 2
arguments in FFI calls while the callee expects 1.

Calling `configure` with the right environment variables fixes the issue:

```
./configure CC=$(which emcc) LD=$(which emcc) --target=js-unknown-ghcjs
```


## Compiler performance

?


## Misc

### Cross-compilation from Linux/Darwin to Windows

TODO: Sylvain (rebased old MR !9310, added missing stuff for Darwin, validated by romes on Darwin)

### Hadrian rules to build the Sphinx-based docs

TODO: Sylvain !9795
