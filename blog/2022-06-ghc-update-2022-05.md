This is the May 2022 monthly update from the GHC DevX team at IOG.

## JavaScript Backend

We have made the following progresses in the implementation of a JavaScript
backend for GHC (adapted from GHCJS):

- **RTS**: we have modified Hadrian and ``rts.cabal`` in order to build a valid
  native ``rts`` unit that GHC can use, in particular containing appropriate
  header files.

- **linker**: the JS linker has been hooked up with GHC's driver.

- **boot libraries**: we have started building boot libraries with the JS
  backend. Trying to build ``ghc-prim`` uncovered a lurking bug related to
  levity polymorphism. It wasn't noticed in GHCJS 8.10 because it is also
  related to the ``BoxedRep`` proposal that introduced a constructor application
  in a commonly used ``RuntimeRep``.

- **sized literals**: support for new sized literals have been added to the code
  generator.

At this stage, we are working on TODO

Development happens in the following branch: https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/tree/wip/js-staging

## External Static Plugins

- tested by Shea Levy, backported to 8.10, trying to make it work in cross-compilers (stage1) for Windows

- command-line interface, better than environment variables

- MR link
